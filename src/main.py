def simulated_task() -> None:
    """
    Simulates a bot task execution with random success/failure outcome.

    This function mimics a real bot task by:
    - Logging the task start
    - Introducing a processing delay
    - Randomly determining success or failure

    Returns:
        bool:
            True if the simulated task succeeds (randomly chosen),
            False if the simulated task fails.

    Example:
        >>> if simulated_task():
        ...     print("Success!")
        ... else:
        ...     print("Failed!")

    Returns:

            The total number of items processed during execution.

    Example:
